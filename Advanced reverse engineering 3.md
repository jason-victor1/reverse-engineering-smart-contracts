## 📌 1️⃣ Live Video Walkthrough of Opcode-Level Analysis

🎥 **What Will the Video Cover?**

- ✔️ Extracting bytecode from a deployed contract
- ✔️ Disassembling bytecode into EVM opcodes
- ✔️ Finding security vulnerabilities at the opcode level
- ✔️ Simulating an exploit using opcode manipulation

> 🚀 A detailed walkthrough video will be shared soon.

## 📌 2️⃣ Hands-On Challenge: Modifying EVM Bytecode for an Attack Simulation

### 🎯 Challenge: Insert a hidden backdoor into raw bytecode to allow unauthorized access.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Deploy the Original Secure Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecureContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdrawAll() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

✅ This contract only allows the owner to withdraw funds.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Extract and Modify the Bytecode

1️⃣ **Compile with solc**

```bash
solc --bin SecureContract.sol -o output/
```

Locate the compiled `*.bin` file inside the `output/` directory.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Insert a Hidden Backdoor in the Bytecode

#### 🔐 Original (Safe) Opcode Pattern

```
DELEGATECALL
PUSH1 0x40
MLOAD
SSTORE
STOP
```

#### 💀 Modified Bytecode (Injected Backdoor)

```
DELEGATECALL
PUSH1 0x40
MLOAD
CALLER   # 🚨 Injects attacker-controlled value!
SSTORE
STOP
```

✅ This now allows `msg.sender` (any address) to hijack ownership and withdraw funds.

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Deploy the Modified Bytecode to a Testnet

**Using Geth:**

```bash
geth --exec "eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], data: '0x<modified_bytecode>'})"
```

Then:

1. Call `withdrawAll()` from a non-owner address
2. Watch the contract transfer funds to the attacker

✅ You have now simulated an opcode-level backdoor exploit.

## 📌 3️⃣ Deep Dive into AI-Powered Smart Contract Decompilers

Traditional bytecode analysis is time-consuming. AI speeds up the process by predicting logic, functions, and vulnerabilities.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: How AI-Powered Decompilers Work

| Traditional Approach       | AI-Enhanced Approach          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Manual opcode review       | Predicts function names       |
| Function names unknown     | Reconstructs pseudo-Solidity  |
| Tedious backdoor detection | Flags vulnerabilities quickly |

**Tools:** Dedaub, SmartScan, or custom LLM-based decompilers

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: AI-Powered Decompiler Example

#### 1️⃣ Use [Dedaub Decompiler](https://library.dedaub.com/)

- Paste contract bytecode or address
- Automatically reconstructs Solidity-like code
- Predicts storage layout, modifiers, and security risks

✅ Results include decompiled logic with detected bugs and alerts.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Train Your Own AI Smart Contract Decompiler

**Install NLP Frameworks**

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

**Example – Classify Bytecode Patterns**

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

bytecode = "PUSH1 0x60 MLOAD SSTORE STOP"
inputs = tokenizer(bytecode, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

print(outputs.logits)  # Predict function category: attack, safe, or unknown
```

✅ AI model can now classify bytecode patterns and help detect suspicious functions.
